# Equation Solver

A simple CLI program for solving basic linear and quadratic equations / finding roots.

## Features

### Linear Equations

- Handles infinite, no or single solutions based on the coefficients

### Quadratic Equations

- Handles cases where a = 0 and b â‰  0 (equation is linear, not quadratic)
- Determines the number and nature of roots based on the discriminant (3 cases)
- Calculates root(s) with the quadratic formular

## ToDo

- Clean up main function
- Add support for all three forms of quadratic equations (vertex form and factored form are not currently supported)
